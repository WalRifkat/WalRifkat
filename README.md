- 👋 Hi, I’m @WalRifkat
- 👀I am currently starting to learn a programming language Pyton
- 🌱 Currently, I am mastering the basic fundamentals of the python programming language, thanks to books that I bought from numerous reviews by people who themselves were once on the threshold of their development in the field of programming.
- 💞️ I am ready to cooperate with those people who are somehow connected with pyton. For some, it may just be a hobby, learning, or python is a subject of professional skill. Glad to meet you!!
- 📫 You can contact me through github or through the feedback form of my site "Technical aspects of Windows" on temowindru
